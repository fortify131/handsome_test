Fortify Software Security Center and AWB Extension Sample : ALM Defect Tracking Integration


-------------
ABOUT
-------------
SSC is distributed with two variants of ALM, Bugzilla, Jira7 and TFS bug tracker plugins:
  a) Pre-built bug tracker plugins in /plugins folder inside SSC Server zip file for their immediate installation and usage
  b) Bug tracker plugin sources in /Samples folder inside SSC Server zip file that can be manually built
       - either without any change (you should get jars with the same functionality as in (a) )
       - or you can modify the original Fortify plugin sources
       - or you can create a completely new plugin taking the original ones as an example

Beginning with SSC version 17.20, the same final plugin jars are used for Fortify Software Security Center (SSC)
and/or for Audit Workbench (AWB).

The bug tracker plugin interface exists as an extension point to allow end users customizing their integration
between SSC/AWB and external defect tracking systems and then to use SSC or AWB GUIs to easily push the found defects there.
User's requests are delegated to the SSC server or to AWB from where appropriate calls to the external defect tracking
systems are submitted.

This sample demonstrates how to implement, build and deploy a bug tracker plugin for ALM.


-------------
REQUIREMENTS
-------------

Building the sample extension requires JDK 1.8 and Gradle 4.x to be installed on the building machine.


-------------
BUILDING
-------------

NOTE:
Without keeping the original plugin implementation class name a bug tracker configuration assigned
  to application versions from previous SSC releases would get broken.

To build the ALM bug tracker sample, simply run from the ALM's sample root directory:

  > gradle clean build

If you have not changed anything a new
    "com.fortify.sample.BugTrackerPluginAlm-17.20.jar"
should be generated in sample's ../dist folder as a result.

For more information how to implement plugin see plugin's interface JavaDoc and SSC documentation.
Bug tracker plugin public interface is distributed in sample's ../lib/fortify-public-[version].jar library.


-----------------
DEPLOYING IN SSC
-----------------
Bug tracker plugin can either replace one of the current installed plugins, or can be added as a new plugin.

Replacing a current bug tracker plugin in SSC
=============================================
1. Start SSC, switch to Administration page
2. Go to the menu <Plugins> -> <Bug Tracking>
3. Disable and remove a plugin you want to replace
4. Submit adding a new bug tracker
5. In the "Upload Plugin Bundle" dialog navigate to the ../dist dir and select
   com.fortify.sample.BugTrackerPluginAlm-xx.yy.jar you've just built
6. Save your changes, enable the installed plugin and start using it

IMPORTANT NOTE:
If you have had the just replaced plugin already configured for some application versions and you want the new plugin
to serve for previously reported bugs, the full name of the new bug tracker implementation class must be exactly the same
as the previous one.
In case of the Fortify original ALM plugin it is
    "com.fortify.sample.bugtracker.alm.AlmBugTrackerPlugin"
The same class name also has to be set in [plugin.xml -> bugtracker class].

Installing a new bug tracker plugin in SSC
==========================================
1. Start SSC, switch to Administration page
2. Go to the menu <Plugins> -> <Bug Tracking>
3. Submit adding a new bug tracker
4. In the "Upload Plugin Bundle" dialog navigate to the ../dist folder and select
   a new custom plugin jar you've just built
5. Save your changes, enable the installed plugin and start using it

Getting more information about bug tracker plugins
==================================================
See the corresponding SSC documentation for more detailed information about:
  - adding/removing BT plugins
  - enabling/disabling BT plugins
  - configuring BT plugins for application versions
  - setting up and using a central SSC proxy with a BT plugin (new in SSC 18.x)
  - using an enhanced "proxy aware" BT plugin API in custom BT plugin implementations (new in SSC 18.x)

IMPORTANT NOTES to plugins versioning:
======================================
1) The pair consisting of
     - plugin symbolic bundle name [MANIFEST.MF -> Bundle-SymbolicName]
     - bundle version [MANIFEST.MF -> Bundle-Version]
   must be unique among all other installed plugins, otherwise the plugin installation fails.
   (Note: this is by OSGi specification)
2) The pair consisting of
     - full name of the bug tracker implementation class [plugin.xml -> bugtracker class]
     - plugin version [MANIFEST.MF -> Version]
   must be unique among all other installed plugins, otherwise the plugin installation fails.
   Also, if you are installing a new plugin version of plugin that is already present in SSC,
   you have to give it a higher plugin version, otherwise SSC will refuse the installation.
   See also the next paragraph (3)
   (Note: this is by SSC design)
3) You can change the plugin version number in gradle script if you need to.
   Plugin version has a format major[.minor[.micro[.qualifier]]] , where all parts can be be numbers only.
   The exact constraint regex is "\d{1,9}(\.\d{1,9}(\.\d{1,9}(\.\d{1,19})?)?)?"
   For the versions comparison the version parts are converted to numbers
   (so for example 3.00148 is higher than 3.025)
4) Version as a part of the bug tracker plugin file name (for example com.fortify.SomePlugin-18.10.jar)
   is neither taken nor used internally as a plugin metadata and has only an informative value.
   So if you for example only rename the jar file from ..SomePlugin-18.10.jar to ..SomePlugin-33.444.jar,
   the internal SSC plugin version still remains 18.10, exactly how it is defined in plugin's MANIFEST.MF.


-----------------
DEPLOYING IN AWB
-----------------

Copy the new or modified plugin jar from ../dist folder to
    <SCA_and_Apps>/Core/private-bin/awb/eclipse/plugins/
and issue an 'eclipse -clean -initialize' command in the 'eclipse' folder.


-------------
USING
-------------

Edit your application version profile within Software Security Center and configure/enable bug tracker plugin integration.
Then you can start directly filing issues from this application version as bugs to the external bug tracker provider.
