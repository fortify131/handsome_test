CUSTOM RULES
============

For flexibility, Fortify Static Code Analyzer enables you to extend default Fortify Rulepacks with custom rules. For details on how to write
custom rules, see the Fortify Static Code Analyzer Custom Rules Guide.

These simple source code samples and Rulepack files illustrate 
rules interpreted by four different analyzers: Semantic, Dataflow, Control
Flow, and Configuration. This folder also contains several miscellaneous real-world rules samples that you can use for scanning real applications.
